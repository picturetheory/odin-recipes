        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Biang biang noodles, or "belt noodles", are a wide, flat, chewy noodle enjoyed in northern China. They're a little time-consuming to make, but very much worth the effort!

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>200g flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>125ml water</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Mix the flour, salt, and water in a bowl until combined.</li>
            <li>Knead until the dough ball comes together.</li>
            <li>Cover and rest for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Knead dough for additional 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Separate dough into 6 pieces and roll into 6-inch-long strips.</li>
            <li>Coat dough with oil and rest, covered, for an additional 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Press a chopstick into the middle of each dough strip (lengthwise) until it leaves a deep impression.</li>
            <li>Grab each end of the dough strip and stretch gently, periodically smacking the middle of the dough strip against the countertop.</li>
            <li>Tear the dough strip down the middle to form two noodles.</li>
            <li>Repeat until all of the dough strips have been stretched into noodles.</li>
            <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil and cook the noodles for 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain the noodles and rinse with cold water to stop cooking and ensure a chewy texture.</li>
